# Pre-work - *Tip Calculator*

**Tip Calculator** is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **Dominic Pham*

Time spent: **5** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [ X] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [ X] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.
* [ ] UI animations
* [ X] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [ X] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [X ] Clear all button

## Notes

A challenge I had to deal with was when the app crashed when adding new features. I had to debug the code and find out which lines were causing the problem.
